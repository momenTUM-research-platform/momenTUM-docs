# momenTUM Designer
<!--short summary of what the designer was build with and how to start off with development-->
The study designer has been built using the following technologies:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - a programming language that adds static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- [React](https://react.dev/) - a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides efficient rendering and component-based architecture.
    - [ReactFlow](https://reactflow.dev/) - a library used for displaying and interacting with the study graph in a visually appealing manner.
    - [ReactJsonSchemaForm](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form) - a library used for generating forms based on JSON schemas and ensuring the correctness of the data entered.
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - a lightweight state management library that simplifies the management and sharing of application state.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - a highly customizable CSS framework that provides utility classes for building responsive and stylish user interfaces.
- [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/) - a collection of pre-designed components that can be used with TailwindCSS.

We recommend familiarizing yourself with these technologies before starting development for this project.
